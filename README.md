# Image-Segmentation
 - Image segmentation means that we can group similar pixels together and give these grouped pixels the same label. The grouping problem is a clustering problem. We used K-means and spectral clustering on the Berkeley Segmentation Benchmark.
- We will talk about each technique and the results of the evaluation using F-measures and Conditional Entropy.

It's a university project for Pattern Recognition at Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University. Computer and Communication Program.

## Before running!
    1. Download BSR.zip, which includes the 50 images with their truth ground images.

# Steps
- Below we will show the needed steps to achieve the goal of the assignment.

## 1. Download the Dataset.
- The dataset contains two folders of images, the original images and the ground truth images which are saved in matlab file format. Each image has 5 ground truth segmentation that will be used later for evaluations. We worked on 50 images with different categories and sizes.

## 2. Visualize the image and the ground truth segmentation.
- display an image with its associated ground truth segmentation.
- display an image with its associated ground truth contour segmentation.
